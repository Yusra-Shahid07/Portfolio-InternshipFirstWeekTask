          <p>
            I'm Yusra Shahid, a BS Computer Science student with a strong
            interest in web development and a passion for coding. I enjoy
            building interactive, user-friendly web applications and bringing
            creative ideas to life through code. Currently focused on learning
            React, I'm developing a solid foundation in front-end development.
            Beyond that, I‚Äôm also exploring exciting fields like cybersecurity
            and artificial intelligence (AI), both of which I hope to dive
            deeper into as my journey in tech continues. With a mindset of
            continuous learning, I actively seek out opportunities through
            personal projects, internships, and emerging technologies to sharpen
            my skills and grow as a developer. My aim is to become a versatile
            developer who builds impactful and meaningful tech solutions.
